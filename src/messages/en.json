    "title": "About Me",
    "text": "I am a motivated team player with a strong commitment to continuous personal and professional growth.\n\nAfter completing my degree in Computer Science at the University of Bonn, I expanded my technical skills through a web development bootcamp, followed by an intensive full-stack web development course with a focus on Next.js and TypeScript.\n\nThese experiences provided me with practical knowledge in building modern full-stack applications and deepened my understanding of current web development standards. I am currently expanding my expertise in React.js and Next.js with the goal of pursuing a position as a full-stack developer.\n\nTo broaden my perspective and strengthen my foundation in software quality, I also completed a quality assurance bootcamp. There, I gained practical experience in test automation, agile methodologies, and the use of tools such as Selenium, Ranorex, and SoapUI. As part of this training, I obtained the ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate and am now a certified software tester.\n\nAlongside my technical background, my experience in the education sector strengthened my communication and teamwork skills, qualities I deeply appreciate in collaborative settings.\n\nMy goal is to combine my technical knowledge with my interpersonal skills to develop software that not only works reliably but also provides real value and an outstanding user experience."
